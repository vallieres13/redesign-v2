# [www.felixhebgen.de](https://www.felixhebgen.de/) - Redesign v2

## Description

This is a redesign of my portfolio. The previous website was built a few years ago and required a rework of various components.
This redesign is built from scratch using React.js, TypeScript, GSAP and WordPress as backend. It is fully responsive and has a modern look and feel.
Further features are caching, lazy loading and minimalistic animations. The website is fully hosted on Oracle Cloud.
